This directory contains core code for GraphRat simulators written in
Python and C.  This version has been extended to support partitioning
of the graph into separate zones.  A zone defines a region of the
graph that may contain non-grid connections, but the only connections
between any two zones will be via grid connections along their mutual
boundary.

Quickstart:

You can run a series of demos by executing:

    linux> make demoX

for X from 1 to 8.

Executable Files:
	grun.py	      Simulator.  Can also operate as visualizer for another simulator
	regress.py    Regression test C version of simulator against Python version.
	benchmark.py  Benchmark C programs and report grades
        submitjob.py  Submit benchmarking jobs when using the Latedays cluster

Python support Files:
	gengraph.py   Used by grun.py to load graphs
	rutil.py      Support for random number generation and value function calculation.
	sim.py        Core simulator implementation
	viz.py        Support for visualization of graphs using ASCII formatting and/or a heat-map representation
	
C Files:
	crun.{h,c}    Top-level control for simulator
	graph.c	      Read in graph
	sim.c         Core simulation code
	simutil.c     Routines for supporting simulation
	rutil.{h,c}   Support for random number generation and value function calculation.
	cycletimer.{h,c} Implements low-overhead, fine-grained time measurements
	instrument.{h,c} Implements instrumentation code to measure time spent by different parts of program.
	fake_omp.{h,c} Substitute OMP functions to enable compiling code for sequential execution


FILE/OUTPUT FORMATS

All files are line-oriented text files, using decimal representations
of numbers.  Any line having the first non-whitespace character equal
to '#' is ignored.

GRAPH FILES

First line of form "N M Z" where N is number of nodes, M is number of
edges, and Z is the number of zones.

Next N lines of form "n LF" declaring nodes in sequence, giving their
ideal load factors

Next M lines of form "e I J" indicating an edge from node I to node J.
The graphs are all undirected, and so there will be entries for both
(I, J) and (J, I).

Nodes must be numbered between 0 and N-1.  Edges must be in sorted
order, with the sorting key first in I and then in J.

Next R lines of the form "r X Y W H" indicating a region with upper
lefthand corner at (X,Y), width W, and height H.

RAT POSITION FILES

First line of form "N R" where N is number of nodes, and R is number
of rats.

Remaining lines of form "I", indicating node number of each successive
rat.  I must be between 0 and N-1.

SIMULATION DRIVER

When operating in driving mode the simulator should produce the
following on each step:

First line: "STEP W H R", where W and H are the width and height of
the underlying grid, and R is the number of rats.

Optionally: R lines of the form "I", giving position of each
successive rat This information can be omitted to reduce bandwidth
requirements.  Display will remain at previous state.

Last line for step: "END"

At the very end, the final line of the stream should be "DONE"

Note: Don't try to print error messages or debugging information for
the simulator on stdout, since this will be piped to grun.py.
Instead, use stderr.  If you need to perform error exit, emit "DONE"
on stdout to terminate visualization.
